# Introduction #

The FlashDevelop Integrated Development Environment (IDE), is a free, open source software used to compile ActionScript to standard output formats like SWF (for the web-based Flash player), and AIR (for desktop and mobile distributions). It can also be used to edit and validate a number of interpreted languages and markup such as Haxe, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, and others.

While it isn't vital to compile TorAS, FlashDevelop is an excellent and cost-free alternative to tools such as Adobe's Flex / Flash Builder and Adobe Flash.
